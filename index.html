        <h2>Shaping the Future of African Healthcare Innovation</h2>
        <p>
        Faith Siva, a doctoral fellow and lecturer at the school, has earned a place in the prestigious Africa Healthcare Innovation Fellowship. Her selection is a declaration that Strathmore’s research community is rising as a force in healthcare innovation across the continent. It signals a future where African solutions to African challenges are born not from abroad, but from within.</p>

        <h2>When AI Meets Medical Imaging</h2>
        <p>
        In the realm of AI-powered health diagnostics, Dr. Henry Muchiri and Dr. Lesley Wakhu are part of an elite international research consortium tackling a silent epidemic. Urinary incontinence. Using AI-assisted 2D ultrasound image analysis, they are developing a diagnostic approach accessible to even the most resource-constrained settings. In partnership with the University of Sheffield, the World Health Organization, and Hacettepe University, their work holds life-changing implications for millions of women worldwide.</p>

    <div>
        <h2>Bright Ideas for Fragile Systems</h2>
        <p>Meanwhile, Dr. Danny Nyatuka is bringing light to remote clinics through the Bright Health Project, which marries renewable energy with agile health IT systems. In partnership with Orbit Health and the University of West London, the project empowers facilities that operate without consistent power or internet, ensuring that vital medical records and decisions are never out of reach.

        His second project is just as urgent. Alongside Dr. Paul Macharia, Faith Siva, Dr. Esther Khakata, and Dr. Betsy Murrithi, he’s leading the Kenyan Neonatal Mortality Risk Predictor, a user-centered innovation designed to transform triage decisions and neonatal outcomes. Grounded in SDG 3.2, this low-cost tool may well be the next lifesaving breakthrough for newborns in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

        <h2>AMBassadors for sustainable transITION</h2>
            <p>
                The Chair has taken a step for the next generation of scientific leaders by offering PhD students a platform to become an advocate and pioneer for the sustainable transition. ‘AMBassadors for sustainable transITION’ in other words AMBITION is an EU-funded project to develop a Joint Honors Programme in technical disciplines. Under the sponsorship of Erasmus+, the project aims to cultivate a cadre of adept young professionals tailored to the different economic, environmental, and cultural backgrounds. The project brings together European and African universities and non-governmental organizations to strengthen the capacity of PhD programmes to produce evidence-based results for sustainable development and green technologies. AMBITION’s motivations are coherent with the AU-EU High Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on Science, Technology and Innovation, to prepare the next ambassadors for sustainability in the Just Transition & Race to Zero.

        <h2>Sisters’ Blended Value Project</h2>
        <div>
        The Sisters’ Blended Value Project focuses on supporting Catholic Sisters to build sustainable social enterprises through developing capacities, supporting networks and information hubs and building robust financial services.

        This follows a baseline survey project commissioned and funded by Conrad N. Hilton Foundation in early 2021, and conducted in Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia by the SBS team in partnership with ACWECA.

        The survey explored the challenges that Catholic sisters face in their ministries in various transformative works that they are involved in as they serve humanity. Some of the challenges established by the study include reduced donor funds, lack of adequate leadership skills and capacities, inadequate financial and organizational sustainability measures etc. 

        In response to the identified issues, SBS has partnered with ACWECA to design the Sisters’ Blended Value Project whose aim is to develop and enhance skills to bridge the identified gaps; as well as support the sisters in identifying networking opportunities that will broaden their vision and ideas.
